List of behavioral components:


MVP

* When user adds new item and hits "Add" then item slides to top of shopping list --> DONE!

* When user adds new item and hits enter on their keyboard then item slides to top of shopping list

* When user clicks already added item, font becomes strikethrough (toggle on and off), or if already strikethrough then becomes normal again

* When user clicks trash can symbol next to item, item disappears


NICE TO HAVES

* Alphabetize button that allows you to sort list alphabetically
